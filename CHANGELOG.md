# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### 🚀 New Features

- **Added token authentication to the `http` output** — the credentials of a request are written in an `auth` section: a user name and a password, a static bearer token, or the OAuth2 client credentials grant, where Eventum takes a token from the configured token endpoint, renews it before it expires and once more when a request comes back rejected. Token requests travel the same TLS settings, proxy and timeouts as the events themselves, and the client secret and the token are secret-bearing fields offering the keyring in Studio. This covers the endpoints that accept nothing else — Azure Monitor Logs Ingestion, Google SecOps, and hosted log APIs handing out tokens with a lifetime

### 📝 Other Changes

- **Moved the `username` and `password` of the `http` output into the `auth` section** — a configuration still carrying the flat keys is rejected, with an error naming the section to write instead. A password given without a user name used to load and authenticate with nothing, which the section makes impossible, and an `Authorization` header written by hand alongside `auth` is now refused rather than silently overridden

  ```yaml
  # before
  output:
    - http:
        url: https://api.example.com/ingest
        username: user
        password: ${secrets.api_password}

  # after
  output:
    - http:
        url: https://api.example.com/ingest
        auth:
          type: basic
          username: user
          password: ${secrets.api_password}
  ```

- **Narrowed the `headers` of the `http` output to string values** — a value of any other type was accepted by the configuration and then refused by the HTTP client, so a header written as a number stopped the generator at start or, once the credential moved into `auth`, failed every event quietly. It is now named where it is written

## 2.8.0 (2026-08-29)

### 🚀 New Features

#### Eventum Studio

- **Extended the scenario data flow diagram to scripts** — the diagram and the cards under it were built from Jinja templates alone, so a generator coordinating through a `script` event plugin looked like it touched no shared key at all. The keys a script reads and writes are detected the same way now and take their place beside the templates, each file opening into its own source inside the card
- **Rebuilt Monitoring into an investigation tool** — the page opens on one line of state: the instances running, the rate every pipeline stage moves events at, what is failing and how full the fullest queue is, in place of three cards of counters. Throughput and failures sit side by side over a window of 2.5, 10 or 30 minutes, and everything about the running instances is now one section — the load chart, split by instance or by pipeline stage with the smallest instances folded into one band, over a table sortable by every figure it shows. Colour and selection are shared between the chart and the table, a search and the quick filters — failing, at the limit, idle — narrow both, and a row opens the details of that instance beside it: the totals behind the rates, what each of its plugins moved, and the state of both queues, one link away from its own page
- **Rebuilt the instance overview around what the instance is doing** — the page opens on one panel across its full width: the rate events enter and leave the pipeline at, what it has moved in total, and what that costs — the processor it takes and whether it waits for one, the memory its queues hold, the bytes it moves. Its throughput over the window and its stage-by-stage graph follow in one column, beside what the instance is — project, mode, autostart, timezone, last run and the scenarios it belongs to, now one panel instead of two. The resources used to be a flat grid of eight figures at the foot of the page, under a column that ended half way up it
- **Rebuilt the About dialog as an identity plate** — the version leads, the runtime and the host follow as one aligned sheet of labelled facts in the mono, tabular treatment the rest of Studio uses for identity values, and the build and the GIL state sit among them. Copying the full information is a labelled button in place of a bare icon
- **Added generator repositories** — Studio connects a git repository, reads the catalog of generators it publishes and installs one as a project of the workspace, in place of cloning the repository by hand and pointing the CLI at a path inside it. A repository is named by its URL and optionally a branch or tag, is checked before it is connected and reports whether it still answers; a private one authenticates with a user name and a password, written either as the value itself or as a `${secrets.<name>}` reference the keyring answers at every fetch, and a password Studio shows back never carries the credential. The catalog is searchable, states what each generator consists of and opens a card of everything the repository says about it. An installed project carries the origin it came from, so a generator the workspace already holds is marked as such and opens the project it became, while installing a second copy — beside the first rather than over it, under a free name — sits in the card of the generator; one the repository has changed since is marked apart. Both survive renaming the project, and neither is fooled by a project that merely shares a name. An installed generator lands under the same guards as an imported archive — symbolic links and submodules are left behind, and the size limits are the same. Studio also lists the repositories that publish generators in the open - a repository joins that list by carrying the `eventum-generators` topic on GitHub, connecting one from there fills the dialog in, and the list pages through what the search found - while stating that the content of a listed repository is not reviewed. Repositories joins the sections on the home screen, in place of the link that led out of Studio to the Hub. The connected repositories are kept in `path.repositories`, which defaults to `repositories.yml` next to the startup file, and the whole flow is available over the HTTP API too
- **Added a keyring picker to the password fields of a project and of a repository** — a password of an output plugin or of a connected repository is written by picking a secret from the keyring, in place of recalling the name and typing the `${secrets.<name>}` reference by hand. A field holding a reference is shown in the clear, since it names a secret rather than carrying one, while a password typed in place keeps its mask
- **Added import and export of projects** — a project leaves Studio as a ZIP archive of its directory and comes back as a new project on the same instance or another one. The export dialog lists every top level entry with its size, so generated output can stay behind, and an import accepts an archive holding the project at its top level as well as one nesting it in directories, the way a download from a repository does. Both operations are available over the HTTP API too
- **Added release highlights to Studio** — what an upgrade brought is now told by the application itself: a short reel of panels, one change each with an animated illustration, that opens by itself on the first load after the running version changes and stays reachable from the user menu. The panels ship inside the build, so an instance with no outbound access shows them as well, and the last of them links to the full changelog. A browser meeting an instance for the first time records the version silently instead of opening the reel
- **Added a channel switch to the instance log viewer** — Main, Server, Access and MCP logs are each streamed on their own, and the logging section of Settings carries the new third-party level
- **Added Download to the project file tree** — a file is saved to the machine you are browsing from through the right-click menu, which states its size before the transfer starts. A file the editor refuses to open offers the same action in place of the note sending you to look for it on disk. Generator output is the case this exists for: it passes the 10 MB editor limit within minutes of a run
- **Reordered the error details dialog by diagnostic value** — the dialog opened with a title and a line derived from the status code, while the sentence the server actually sent sat below the full request and response. It now leads with what the server reported, followed by the context or the rejected fields named alongside it, then one line naming the call and its status. The raw request and response moved behind a single toggle, each drawn as its own card - the request line or the status code at the top, headers as a key-value list, body highlighted and clipped only when long. A response that does not match its schema lists the fields it failed on instead of reporting only `Unexpected server response`

#### Core

- **Split the logs by component and unified their format** — a record now goes to the file of the part it came from: `main.log` for the application core, `server.log` for the API and the HTTP server, `server_access.log` for requests, `mcp.log` for the MCP server, and `generator_<id>.log` for everything a generator does, down to the HTTP and broker traffic its output plugins produce and the requests its `http` input plugin serves, all of which used to flood the shared log. All of them carry the same ISO-UTC timestamp, level and logger name, third-party records included, and `log.format: json` now reaches the server files too. Console output is unchanged as the combined view of every channel, with a `component` field naming the origin. `server_error.log` is gone - its contents are part of `server.log`
- **Added per-instance resource accounting** — an instance now reports the CPU time of the threads it runs, the time they spent ready to run while waiting for a processor, how many of them there are, the bytes they read and wrote through the file system, the bytes they moved over the network, and how full the queues between its pipeline stages are. The instance page turns the CPU time into its share of a core over the last interval, so the instance responsible for the load on a host running several of them is visible instead of inferred, and a growing wait separates an instance the host cannot keep up with from a slow one. Monitoring ranks every running instance by what it occupies right now — processor share, waiting, threads, bytes to disk and over the network, and the memory its events queue holds — next to the load chart that already showed how much each of them produces, and the instance list gains a sortable CPU column. Management adds what the application itself occupies — its resident memory next to the host's, and its open descriptors against the limit they run out at. Memory of a single instance stays absent by nature: instances share one process heap, and no per-instance figure for it exists to report
- **Bounded the memory an instance holds in flight** — the queue between the event and the output stage was limited in batches alone, and a batch is as large as the events in it, so ten batches of ten thousand events came to anything between twenty megabytes and half a gigabyte depending on the templates, with nothing reporting which. The queue now also holds no more than `generation.queue.max_event_bytes`, 256 MiB by default, counting a batch until the writes of that batch are finished rather than until it leaves the queue, and reports that figure next to the batches it holds; a configuration whose events are large enough to reach the limit trades some of the buffer it never knew it had for an instance whose events in flight are bounded in memory. The limit can be raised, lowered per instance, or lifted entirely. Starting many instances at once no longer compiles all their templates at the same time either - four are started at a time, so a scenario of fifty comes up slightly slower and without the spike
- **Named the caller in the records of a served request** — everything logged while serving a request carries the address of the client that caused it, so an MCP tool call or an API failure can be traced to its caller without stitching the access log to another channel by timestamp
- **Added `log.third_party_level`** — the level of third-party libraries, `warning` by default and independent of `log.level`, so a debug run of Eventum no longer comes with the debug output of every dependency
- **Reported the state of the GIL in instance info** — Eventum runs its generators on threads, and a free-threaded Python is what lets them run in parallel, yet nothing told which build a running instance ended up on. `GET /instance/info` and the `eventum://instance/info` MCP resource now carry whether the interpreter is a free-threaded build and whether the GIL is enabled at that moment, and the Management page shows the state in its Application card. On a free-threaded build the GIL can come back after startup — through `PYTHON_GIL=1`, `-X gil=1`, or an extension module imported by a plugin without free-threading support — which costs that parallelism silently, so the page reports it as a warning

#### Plugins

- **Handed the global state to the `script` plugin** — the process-wide `globals` state arrives in the `produce` function of a script as a `globals` key of its parameters, so a script correlates its events with other generators through the same keys Studio, the API and MCP already read and write. Scripts written against `timestamp` and `tags` alone keep working. The state is no longer a template facility - it belongs to the event stage, and the guarantee that a lock left acquired is released at the end of the event now holds for every event plugin
- **Bounded what a shell command started from a template can consume** — a `subprocess.run` call now runs under a timeout of 30 seconds when the template passes none and at most 300 seconds when it asks for more, a command that runs out of time is killed together with the processes it spawned, and a command writing more than 8 MiB to one of its output streams is stopped with an error instead of having all of it held in memory. A call without an explicit timeout used to stall its generator indefinitely, leave background processes running and grow the memory of the whole instance

#### MCP

- **Added connected repository tools** — an agent lists the generator repositories the instance is connected to, reads the catalog one publishes and installs a generator from it as a project of the workspace, in place of asking the user to fetch it by hand. A catalog entry states what the generator produces, what it consists of and which projects it is already installed as, and whether the repository has published it differently since. Installing is a write tool, so it needs a writable server; connecting and disconnecting a repository stays with the user, since it names credentials. An agent also lists what is published in the open, so it can name a repository for the user to connect when the workspace holds nothing for a data source. The stdio server reads the same list an instance keeps, taken from `--repositories` or from `repositories.yml` next to the generators directory
- **Added `export_generator` and `import_generator`** — an agent moves a whole generator project in or out as a ZIP archive instead of copying it file by file. Archive content travels inline, so an archive over 128 KiB is refused and the REST API carries it instead
- **Added `get_instance_logs`** — an agent can read any log channel of the instance, not just the log of a generator, to diagnose the server itself. Paths and the server password are stripped from the lines, while the request line of an access record is kept readable
- **Added the resources of an instance to the MCP stats tool** — `get_generator_stats` reported throughput and failures, so an agent asked why a generator is slow could not tell a busy instance from a starved one. It now carries the same resource figures the API does: threads, processor time, waiting, disk and network bytes, and the fill level of both pipeline queues

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Eventum Studio

- **Recovered Studio from a failed asset load** — a page whose code or stylesheet never arrived left the whole app on the error screen, most often while a busy generator slowed the instance down. Such a page now reloads the document once, and only a failure that survives the reload reaches the error screen. The application shell is no longer reused from the browser cache either, so it can no longer outlive an upgrade and ask for files the new build does not carry
- **Made Studio hold together on narrow screens** — a window under about 1250px pushed the page sideways and put the rightmost table columns, the row menus among them, out of reach behind the page scrollbar; under 768px the navigation panel took over the whole viewport and opened on top of the page on every load. Wide tables now scroll inside their own panel, the navigation panel keeps separate desktop and mobile state and closes itself once a destination is chosen, and the header, the instance title, the Settings section list and the sign-in card give way in place of overflowing
- **Kept the Studio editor from being squeezed out by its neighbours** — the file explorer and the inspector held their full width while the editor absorbed every bit of narrowing, down to 134px of code at a 1024px window and 10px at 900px. The editor now keeps 360px and the two side panels give way first; below 1200px the three panels stop sharing the row and take turns instead, chosen from a switcher, with the pipeline strip scrolling in place of overflowing
- **Bound the plugin parameters form to the plugin instead of its position in the list** — deleting an input or output plugin left the form filled with the deleted plugin's values, and the next edit wrote them over the plugin that took its place. Deleting a plugin listed above the selected one also moved the selection to a neighbour
- **Kept a lifted limit lifted** — an events queue whose byte limit was switched off, and a batching mode formed by size or by delay alone, were read back from the instance as if the setting had never been made: the switch came back on, the mode came back combined, and saving the page then wrote the default limit over the choice. Such a setting is now carried both ways, so switching the byte limit off holds and an instance batching by one condition keeps doing so
- **Reread the instance settings after saving them** — the page wrote the settings and then kept showing what it had read before the write, since the answer it stored in their place carries no body. Reopening Settings without reloading the tab showed the previous values until something else refreshed them
- **Named the project of an instance registered from outside the workspace** — an instance whose configuration lies elsewhere on the host showed the whole directory of that configuration as its project name and offered it as a link to a project page that cannot exist. It now names the directory it sits in and shows the path in place of the link
- **Kept the projects table from spinning when it is given no instance filter** — the filter it falls back to was rebuilt on every render, and the effect that applies it wrote state on every one, so a table mounted without that filter re-rendered without end
- **Played the click of the release scenes** — every scene that clicks something animated a part under a name the cursor does not carry, so in four of the five the pointer reached its target and nothing answered
- **Completed the state helpers the template editor offers** — `pop` is part of the state every template scope carries, and the editor never offered it, so it was the one call a template had to be written from memory
- **Named the controls a reader is only told are buttons** — the sort control of every table column, the close of the instance details panel, the autostart and past-skip switches of an instance, and the shortcuts that set a tabulation or a line feed as a delimiter carried no name at all, so a screen reader announced each of them as an unlabelled button

#### Core

- **Stopped a secret named after a mapping operation from substituting one** — a reference is read as an expression, so a secret named `keys`, `items` or `aws.get` answered with a method of the collection holding the secrets in place of the value, written into the configuration without an error. Names address entries now and nothing else, for `${params.*}` as well
- **Refused a secret name no configuration can reference** — the keyring took any name that was not blank, while a reference to it is read as an expression of the configuration being rendered, so a secret named `my-secret`, `1secret` or `my key` could be stored and listed and then failed every generator that referenced it. A name holding a closing brace was worse: `${secrets.a}b}` read the secret named `a` and kept the rest as text, so the credential of one destination was sent to another with nothing reporting it. A name holding a capital was a third shape: the keyring folds the case of a name while the value is encrypted against the name as it was given, so `API_TOKEN` was listed as `api_token` and could not be read by either spelling, and writing both spellings left the first unreadable for good. A name is now words of lowercase letters, digits and `_` separated by `.`, refused where it is written — the CLI, the API, Studio and the rename tool of an agent — and names already in a keyring are left as they are
- **Stopped escaping non-ASCII text in configuration files** — a project saved through Studio, the API or MCP had its Cyrillic and other non-ASCII values written out as `\uXXXX` sequences, in `generator.yml` as well as in the instance settings and the startup file. Values are now stored as they were entered, and JSON-format logs and MCP resources report them the same way
- **Fixed reading and writing files outside a UTF-8 environment** — configurations, templates, samples, time patterns and log files were read and written in whatever encoding the host locale happened to set, which mangled non-ASCII content or failed outright. All of them are now UTF-8 regardless of the host, and a configuration that cannot be decoded is reported as an encoding error instead of an unhandled failure
- **Made the report of what uses a secret account for connected repositories** — a secret only a connected repository authenticates with was reported as used by nothing, on the Secrets page as well as through the API and the `list_secret_references` MCP tool, so renaming or removing it looked safe while it left the repository pointing at a name that no longer exists. What refers to a secret is now answered as two lists — the projects whose configuration reads it as `${secrets.<name>}`, and the repositories authenticating with it — and renaming a secret carries every referrer over to it: the token is rewritten in the configuration of each project reading the secret, and each repository authenticating with it is repointed. A configuration is rewritten as text, so its comments and its formatting stay as they were written, and a generator already running keeps the configuration it loaded and reads the new name the next time it starts. Removing a secret states the same two lists before it goes ahead, since a removal repoints nothing and both kinds of referrer stop working until a secret of that name exists again, and a rename onto a name a repository already authenticates with is refused — the keyring holds one value per name, so that repository would otherwise start authenticating with the value that just moved under it. A list of repositories that cannot be read now fails the report instead of answering that nothing uses the secret
- **Rewrote the pipeline backpressure warnings** — a write that ran out of time blamed the event rate and warned about losing events that were already lost. The three warnings now state what actually happened — a write was cancelled and its events counted as failed, or a queue filled up and events fall behind their timestamps — and carry the remedies as a separate hint, since a slow or unavailable output target, an oversized batch and a short write timeout produce the same symptom as an excessive rate. Repeated write timeouts are reported once per ten seconds per output plugin with a running count, instead of one line per cancelled write

#### Plugins

- **Stopped a stalled TCP target from taking the memory and the shutdown with it** — events handed to a connection whose target stopped reading stayed in the buffer of that connection, which nothing bounded: the memory of the application grew for as long as the instance kept generating, and stopping the instance waited for that buffer to reach the target, which on a slow one took many minutes with the instance stuck in Stopping. A write into a connection that is already backed up now fails at once and its events are counted as failed, a write given up on after `write_timeout` drops its connection instead of leaving the events in it, and closing a connection waits five seconds for what is buffered before dropping it. Events counted as failed are now genuinely not delivered, where before some of them reached the target minutes later
- **Released the global template state lock at the end of every event** — a template that called `globals.acquire()` and never reached `globals.release()`, most often because rendering failed in between, held the process-wide lock for good, freezing every other generator that reads or writes global state along with the Studio and MCP views of it. Templates can also drop their own holds through `globals.release_if_held()`
- **Bounded the requests the `http` output keeps in flight** — a formatter that serializes each event on its own (`plain`, `json`, `template`) made the plugin open a request per event, so a batch of the default size fired up to 10000 requests at once through a pool of 100 connections, and the write was cancelled on its timeout with every event it carried counted as failed. The number of requests performed at a time is now capped by the plugin's new `concurrency` field, 100 by default, which sizes the connection pool as well. Failures of one write are reported as one line per status code with a count, in place of one line per event

#### API/CLI

- **Blocked access to files a project only points at** — a path made of plain directory names, with no `..` anywhere in it, still left the project directory whenever a symlink stood along it, and the file it landed on was read, written, moved, copied or deleted like a file of the project. Such a path is now refused; a symlink that stays inside the project keeps working as before

### ⚡ Performance

- **Formed batches by size wherever the delay bounds nothing** — `batch.delay` caps the time span of the timestamps one batch covers, which bounds the lag batching adds to delivery. Timestamps that have already passed carry no such lag, and sample mode emits on no schedule at all, so in both cases the cap only cut the stream into batches the size of the event rate. Both are now grouped by `batch.size` alone: half an hour of live backlog at 10 events per second drains in 2 batches instead of 1798. `batch.delay` still forms the batches of timestamps ahead of real time in live mode, and still applies everywhere `batch.size` is unset, where it is the only limit a batch has. A sample-mode run through a per-batch formatter such as `json-batch` writes larger arrays than before as a result

### 🧪 Testing

#### Eventum Studio

- **Covered the Studio flows with browser tests** — Playwright drives the packaged interface against a real backend started over a throwaway directory of its own, across every screen it has: signing in and out, the navigation, projects created of each type and renamed, exported, imported and deleted, the file explorer and the editor beside it, the pipeline and its plugins, the timestamp preview and the event debugger, instances registered, started, watched, cloned, renamed and deleted, their settings and their log, scenarios grouping instances and acting on them together, monitoring, secrets, connected repositories, the management console, and a configuration the backend cannot parse opening the project in recovery mode and leaving it once repaired. They run on pull requests and once a night rather than on every push, since they drive a real pipeline
- **Grew the unit suite from 280 tests to over fifteen hundred** — the API boundary and the schemas mirroring the backend models, the caches every screen reads its data from, the configuration forms of every plugin down to each field of them, the studio panels and the draft they edit, the tables and the actions on their rows, and the pages and dialogs that act on an instance, a project or a repository are covered now. `pnpm test:coverage` reports the figure against a threshold, so a change that lowers coverage fails instead of passing unnoticed

#### Other

- **Checked the Studio stylesheets, formatting and coverage in CI** — the frontend checks run Stylelint and Prettier beside the ESLint, unit tests and build they already ran, and report coverage against a threshold. They also moved to a workflow of their own, scoped to the UI package, so a change to the backend alone no longer installs a node toolchain. Stylelint and Prettier had been left to whoever remembered to run them, and formatting had already drifted in three files

### 📝 Other Changes

- **Gave the preview produce endpoint its own request model** — the body of `POST /preview/{name}/event-plugin/produce` was described by the very type the pipeline hands to an event plugin, so the published schema answered to an internal contract. The body is now `ProduceParamsRequest`, identical in shape - the same `timestamp` and `tags` - and, like the rest of the preview endpoints, it rejects a body carrying anything else
- **Moved the preview global state endpoints out of the template subtree** — `/preview/{name}/event-plugin/template/state/global` is now `/preview/{name}/event-plugin/state/global` and no longer requires the initialized plugin to be a template, since the state it reads belongs to every event plugin. The local and shared endpoints keep their paths, and the globals usage report of a generator names the file a key was found in as `path` where it used to say `template`
- **Removed the flat `server.ui_enabled` and `server.api_enabled` keys** — deprecated in 2.7.0 in favour of `server.ui.enabled` and `server.api.enabled`, they were accepted with a notice at startup for one release and are now rejected as unknown settings. A configuration still holding one has to move the value under its nested section
- **Changed the application disk counters to file system bytes** — they reported what reached the block device, which the kernel credits to whichever thread it flushes the page cache from and which therefore cannot be broken down per instance. Both the application and the per-instance figures now count the bytes handed to the system calls, so they add up

## 2.7.0 (2026-08-01)

### 🚀 New Features

#### Eventum Studio

- **Restyled every screen on one design system** — matched dark and light themes, one status palette, and consistent surfaces, controls, tables and menus
- **Rebuilt the project page into a development studio** — a docked workspace of file explorer, tabbed code editor, stage inspector and a console holding the timestamp preview, event debugger, template state and formatter. One Save covers the configuration and every edited file, and the debug tools keep their results while you move between stages. A `generator.yml` that fails to parse now opens in recovery mode with the error over the editor instead of locking the project out
- **Rebuilt the instance page into a live overview** — Overview, Settings and Logs tabs. Overview draws live throughput over the pipeline with per-plugin counters, the instance's project, mode, autostart, timezone and last run, and its scenarios with inline add and remove. The header carries live status, uptime and Start / Stop / Restart; the log viewer is embedded and streams only while its tab is open
- **Rebuilt Monitoring into a live dashboard** — animated Input → Event → Output flow with per-stage metrics, throughput and failure charts over a rolling window, each instance's share of the output load, and CPU, memory, disk and network tiles
- **Rebuilt Management into an instance console** — application and host identity (version, Python, platform, address, uptime), a CPU and memory snapshot, the application log streamed in the page instead of behind a modal, and a danger zone for restart and stop
- **Added runtime stats and filters to the tables** — running instances show Flow (average output EPS), Errors and Written as sortable columns. Projects filters by All / In use / Unused, Instances by All / Active / Inactive, Scenarios by All / Running / Inactive, each list counts its records, and every table has a first-run and a no-match state. Filters live in the URL, so a filtered view is linkable. Project rows carry instance chips that link to their instance and light up while it runs
- **Reworked Settings, Secrets and the scenario page** — Settings splits into a Server / Generation / Paths / Logging rail with Save pinned in the header and a dot on sections holding unsaved edits; Secrets adds entries through an inline form with a password field and copyable names; the scenario page gains an aggregate status header with Start all and Stop all, and inline syntax-highlighted template previews
- **Added an unsaved-changes guard** — leaving an instance or a project with unsaved changes asks for confirmation on any navigation and warns before a refresh or a closed tab; previously only the back button was covered
- **Added a Rename action to projects, instances, scenarios and secrets** — an object no longer has to be recreated to carry a different name. A renamed project moves its directory and every instance using it follows, so those instances must be stopped first; a renamed instance keeps its parameters and scenario membership; a renamed scenario has its tag rewritten on all its instances; a renamed secret keeps its value, and the dialog lists the projects reading it as `${secrets.<name>}`, since those placeholders are not rewritten
- **Added a Clone action to the instance row menu** — creates a new instance from an existing one, reusing its project and all parameters
- **Made Studio navigation link-based** — record names, sidebar items, breadcrumbs, home cards and in-page links are real links, so middle-click and Ctrl/Cmd-click open them in a new browser tab; middle-click also closes an editor tab. Selecting a record name no longer opens it, so names stay copyable
- **Added file sizes to the project file tree** — every file shows its size next to its name, and a file over 10 MB is not opened in the editor: the tab reports the size and the limit instead of transferring a file the editor cannot display. Generator output files are the usual case
- **Rebuilt the editor search panel** — Ctrl/Cmd-F opens a compact panel floating over the top-right corner of the editor instead of a strip stretched across its bottom edge. The query field counts the matches and marks a malformed expression, case, regular-expression and whole-word matching are icon toggles, and the replace row is revealed on demand
- **Lit the indicator of a live instance** — a running, starting or stopping instance carries a halo around its status indicator everywhere it appears: Home, Monitoring, Instances, Scenarios and the scenario diagram. The states at rest carry none, so a live instance reads without comparing it to anything

#### MCP

- **Added rename tools for projects, generators, scenarios and secrets** — over HTTP an agent can rename each of them with the same guards the UI applies: a renamed project moves its directory and repoints the generators using it (all of which must be stopped), a renamed generator keeps its parameters and scenario membership, a renamed scenario has its tag rewritten everywhere, and a renamed secret keeps its value without ever exposing it. `list_secret_references` reports the projects reading a secret, so the agent can name what a rename breaks; `${secrets.*}` tokens are never rewritten. Adding and reading a secret value stay outside MCP
- **Added tools for scenarios, global state, settings and instance control** — over HTTP an agent can manage scenarios (list, inspect, add or remove a generator, delete), read and edit the shared global state, read host/runtime info and the running settings (credentials redacted, absolute paths shortened), patch the settings file, and stop or restart the instance. Write tools stay gated behind `server.mcp.allow_write`; credentials cannot be changed over MCP, settings apply on the next restart, and stopping or restarting ends the agent's own connection

#### API/CLI

- **Added rename endpoints for projects, instances, scenarios and secrets** — `POST /<resource>/{key}/rename` on each of the four resources, carrying the same guards: renaming a project reports the instances it repointed and is refused while any of them is active, renaming an instance is refused while it runs, and a name already taken is refused as a conflict. `GET /secrets/{name}/references` lists the projects reading a secret as `${secrets.<name>}`
- **Reported file sizes in the generator file tree** — every file node carries its size, so a client can decide what to do with a file before requesting it; a file whose size cannot be read is reported as unknown instead of failing the whole tree

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Eventum Studio

- **Gave file transfers their own request deadline** — every request from Studio shared a single 10-second deadline, so opening or uploading a large project file failed while the transfer was still running. Requests that carry file content now run without a deadline and the rest have 60 seconds; a request that does run out of time says so instead of reporting a generic failure
- **Told a finished instance apart from a running one at a glance** — Finished carried a green-teal chip that read as Active's green once diluted into a status chip, so a stopped instance looked like it was still running. A status chip now stays coloured only while an instance is live: an instance at rest takes a neutral chip and names its outcome through the status indicator alone - a deep green for finished, a deep red for failed - dark enough to read as switched off
- **Added MCP controls to the Server settings section** — the HTTP server toggle, write-tool permission, mount path and allowed hosts are now editable in Studio; previously they lived only in `eventum.yml`, and saving settings from Studio reset them to defaults
- **Cleared the cached project configuration on delete and create** — a project created with the name of a deleted one starts from a clean configuration instead of showing the old project's settings
- **Restricted the Write timeout field to whole seconds** — it accepted fractional values that the configuration then rejected on save
- **Read the cron seconds field in the generator's order** — the text under the cron Expression field took the seconds as the first field, so `35 10 * * * 3` was described as "At 35 seconds past the minute … only on Wednesday" while the generator fires at 10:35:03 every day. The description and the validity check now follow `minute hour day month weekday second year`, and the field hint spells the order out
- **Accepted cron expressions carrying random values or parameters** — `0 0 R * *` and `${params.schedule}` were rejected as invalid although the generator runs them; the field checked what could be spelled out in words rather than what the generator accepts. Both are accepted now, with a note under the field saying the schedule is resolved at run time
- **Validated the HTTP output form against its own rules** — the form checked its values against the file output's rules instead, so a malformed URL or an out-of-range response code drew no inline error and surfaced only once the configuration was read
- **Matched the plugin switches to the generator's defaults** — a field the configuration does not mention was drawn as off, so Verify SSL on the `http`, `opensearch`, `clickhouse` and `tcp` outputs read as unchecked while the generator was verifying the certificate, and Include end point on the `linspace` input read as off while the range included it. A switch now shows what the field resolves to, and an untouched field is still left out of the configuration
- **Reported the restart and the stop on the Management page** — the page went on claiming the instance was running and then reported a failure to reach it. Its status now switches to Restarting or Stopping, and the page loads afresh a moment later, so it shows the instance as it stands - running again, or unreachable
- **Cut long file names in the project file tree** — a name wider than the panel wrapped onto a second line and broke the row rhythm; it is trimmed with an ellipsis now and shown in full on hover. The file size beside it is rounded to whole units and set smaller, as metadata rather than as part of the name

#### Core

- **Stopped splitting generator configuration keys on dots** — every key holding a dot was expanded into nested keys, so a state machine comparing a state field (`ge: {shared.step: 5}`) was rejected as invalid, and a template parameter, sample or template name written with a dot arrived reshaped. A generator configuration is now read exactly as written; the dot-separated shorthand for nested settings stays in `eventum.yml`, `startup.yml` and time-pattern files, and a generator configuration spells `formatter.format: plain` out as a nested block
- **Read the dotted name of a `${params.*}` or `${secrets.*}` token as a path** — `${params.opensearch.host}` matched only a parameter whose full name was `opensearch.host`, and even then substituted nothing, so a nested parameter (the form `startup.yml` documents) and a parameter or keyring secret named with a dot were both unreachable. A token name now addresses the value spelled exactly like it or the path of nested names; a name addressing nothing is reported as missing
- **Closed streaming connections on graceful shutdown** — Ctrl+C with a live log view or a connected MCP client now exits in well under a second, instead of waiting out the shutdown timeout and printing cancellation errors
- **Scoped the network and disk figures to the Eventum process** — the Disk I/O and Network tiles measured the whole host. Disk now comes from the process and network bytes are counted inside the application; CPU and memory stay host-level, and all counters are cumulative since startup

#### Plugins

- **Restored parallel generation alongside the `clickhouse` output** — loading the plugin on free-threaded Python re-enabled the GIL for the whole process, so every generator lost parallelism, not only the one writing to ClickHouse. The ClickHouse client is now required at a version whose compiled modules keep the GIL disabled
- **Serialized the loading of plugins across generators** — starting several generators at once could leave one of them Failed during plugin initialization with an internal error naming nothing the user controls, while its siblings using the same plugin started normally, and a manual restart of that generator recovered it. On free-threaded Python two generators loading their plugins at the same moment interfered inside the construction of the configuration classes; a plugin is now loaded by one generator at a time
- **Dropped the unsatisfiable constraint on the certificate fields of the `clickhouse`, `opensearch` and `http` outputs** — `ca_cert`, `client_cert` and `client_cert_key` carried a text-length constraint that cannot apply to a path, so any value failed with a type error while the configuration was read, leaving certificate-based TLS unusable (Thanks to [Sai Asish Y](https://github.com/SAY-5) for the PR!)
- **Turned certificate verification on by default in the `opensearch` and `http` outputs** — `verify` defaulted to `false`, so an `https://` endpoint was trusted without any check unless verification was requested explicitly, while `clickhouse` and `tcp` checked the same connection. A generator writing to an endpoint with a self-signed or internal-CA certificate now fails with a certificate error: point `ca_cert` at the issuing CA, or set `verify: false` to keep the connection unchecked
- **Reported a failed bind of the `http` input as a generation error** — a generator whose port was already taken produced no timestamps and no diagnosis; it now fails with the bind address and the server exit code
- **Counted every event an output failed to deliver** — an output that loses events one by one - a request the collector rejects, a document the bulk response refuses, a message the broker drops, an event that cannot be encoded - logged each loss and subtracted it from its written count, but recorded it nowhere else, so an instance delivering nothing read exactly like an idle one: fewer written events than produced, every failure counter at zero. Those events now land in `write_failed`
- **Counted every event rejected by a formatter in the failure metrics** — `format_failed` moved only when formatting failed for a whole batch, so a single malformed event among valid ones was dropped without a trace in the instance metrics, the Monitoring dashboard and the Errors column, leaving Written short of Produced with nothing to explain the gap. The `json` and `template` formatters now count their rejections per event, and a batch rejected as a whole by `json-batch` or `template-batch` counts all of its events
- **Stopped writing an empty JSON array when `json-batch` rejects every event of a batch** — the destination received `[]` instead of nothing

#### MCP

- **Bounded what file access hands to the agent** — `read_generator_file` returned the whole file, so an output file or a large sample went into the agent's context in one piece. A call now returns at most 64 KB, 256 KB when asked for, ending on a complete line, and reports the file size with the offset to continue from, so an agent pages through anything larger. `describe_sample` parses a sample whole, the way a run loads it, so it now refuses a file above 32 MB and points at the windowed read instead. The authoring prompt tells the agent how to page a read
- **Widened the guidance given to agents** — large CSV/JSON samples go through the REST file API (over HTTP) or straight to disk (locally) instead of the slow `write_generator_file` tool. The agent is also told that templates can import any installed Python package and run shell commands via `subprocess`, that the server exposes an OpenAPI schema to fall back on when no tool fits, and how live/sample modes and scenarios work

#### API/CLI

- **Served a generator file as a snapshot of the moment it was requested** — reading an output file of a running generator aborted mid-response, because the response declared the file size before reading the file and the file kept growing. A file that cannot be read now answers with an error instead of a dropped connection
- **Moved the scenario global-state scan to a worker thread** — a scenario with many generators opens instead of hanging and failing after about ten seconds
- **Served the websocket API schema from memory** — the schema was written into the installed package on every application start, so an installation on a read-only filesystem refused to start over a documentation file, and the served schema carried the version and bind address of whoever last started the application. It is now held in memory and always describes the running instance
- **Read host and runtime facts when they are requested** — the host name, IPv4 address, platform string, Python build and host boot time were captured once as the application loaded and published as defaults in the API schema, so the reference on the documentation site described the machine that exported it. They are now resolved per request and no longer appear in the schema

### ⚡ Performance

- **Stopped rebuilding the editor configuration on every keystroke** — typing in a project file rebuilt the editor's language mode, autocomplete, search and save shortcut on each character, which told on a large file. The configuration is now built once per opened file

### 🧪 Testing

- **Added a component-test harness to Eventum Studio** — the UI suite runs in jsdom with React Testing Library, so a screen or a control can be mounted and driven from a test instead of only its pure helpers being covered

### 📝 Other Changes

- **Renamed the status of an instance that has not run from Inactive to Idle** — Inactive is the total covering every instance at rest, and the fleet summary already broke it down into finished, failed and idle, so the state carrying the name of its own total now reads Idle. The Instances status filter follows the chips it filters and reads All / Active / Inactive, where Inactive covers finished, failed and idle alike; a link pinned to `status=running` falls back to All
- **Nested the `server.ui` and `server.api` config sections** — the web UI and REST API toggles moved under `server.ui.enabled` and `server.api.enabled`, matching `server.mcp`. The flat `server.ui_enabled` and `server.api_enabled` keys still work but are deprecated, warn at startup and go away in 2.8; mixing a flat key with its nested form is rejected

## 2.6.0 (2026-06-11)

### 🚀 New Features

- **MCP server — connect an AI agent to Eventum** — a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server lets an agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, and others) author, validate, preview, and run generators using its own model; Eventum embeds no LLM. It runs over **stdio** (`eventum mcp`) for local authoring, and as an optional **HTTP service** mounted into the server (`server.mcp.enabled`) for live management behind Basic auth. The agent gets plugin/formatter/sample discovery and secret-name listing, an always-current template-helper reference, the top-level config schema, worked examples, generator file read/write/delete, real-engine `validate`/`preview_timestamps`/`preview_events`, and ready-made prompts for authoring a generator and live ops; over HTTP it also gets `list`/`status`/`start`/`stop`/`register`/`unregister` and scrubbed log reading of running generators. Over HTTP, write tools are disabled by default and gated by `server.mcp.allow_write`; the stdio server is writable for local authoring unless `--read-only` is passed
- **`samples.<name>.where(**conditions)`** — filter sample rows by multiple equality conditions in a single call (AND-combined). Replaces verbose chained `selectattr` and returns a `Sample` that supports further `where`/`pick` calls
- **`pick(default=...)` and `weighted_pick(weight, default=...)`** — return a fallback value when the sample is empty instead of raising; `pick_n` and `weighted_pick_n` return `[]` on empty samples
- **`module.rand.network.ip_v6` family** — generate random IPv6 addresses: `ip_v6()` for the full space, `ip_v6_global()` for global unicast (`2000::/3`), `ip_v6_link_local()` for link-local (`fe80::/10`), `ip_v6_ula()` for unique local (`fc00::/7`)
- **`module.rand.network.mac(oui=..., vendor=...)`** — fix the OUI prefix to a 3-byte string (e.g. `mac(oui="00:50:56")`) or pick one at random from a built-in table for a given vendor (e.g. `mac(vendor="dell")`); 20 vendor keys cover Apple, Cisco, Dell, HP, Intel, VMware, and others. No-argument call keeps the previous fully-random behavior
- **`module.rand.network.ip_v4_private()`** — generate a random RFC 1918 private IPv4 address from any class (`10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`) with realistic weights
- **`module.rand.string.pattern(format_string)`** — build random strings from a printf-like pattern with specifiers `%a %A %l %d %n %h %H %p %w %%` and repeat syntax `{N}` (e.g. `pattern("ORD-%A{3}-%d{6}")`)
- **ClickHouse output: `pool_maxsize` parameter** — configure the HTTP connection pool size toward the ClickHouse host (default `32`); raise it together with `generation.max_concurrency` to avoid `Connection pool is full` warnings and connection churn under bursts of concurrent writes
- **`module.rand.crypto.sha1()`** — generate a random 40-character hex string (SHA-1-length)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Failed server startup no longer hangs the app** — when the server cannot start (e.g. the port is already in use), `eventum run` now stops the generators and exits with a clear `Server failed to start` error instead of running headless until interrupted; a server that dies after a successful startup now shuts the whole app down instead of leaving it running without a server
- **Dot-separated config keys work at any depth, in every YAML file** — previously only the top level of `eventum.yml` understood dotted keys, so a nested spelling like `server: {mcp.enabled: true}` was rejected with `extra inputs are not permitted`. Now `eventum.yml`, generator configs, `startup.yml`, and time-pattern files all accept dotted keys at any nesting level, both spellings can be mixed and are deep-merged, and defining the same key twice fails with the exact conflicting path
