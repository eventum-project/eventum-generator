"""In-process network byte accounting.

psutil reports network counters only system-wide (``net_io_counters``),
never per process, and the operating system exposes no portable
per-process network byte counter. To report how much traffic *this
application* moves, this module wraps the send and receive methods of
``socket.socket`` so every byte the process passes through a Python
socket is counted.

Eventum's network output plugins (tcp, udp, http, opensearch and otlp
via httpx, kafka via aiokafka, clickhouse) all run on asyncio and route
through Python sockets, so the counters reflect the application's real
network I/O - including TLS, whose encrypted bytes reach the raw socket.
Counts are cumulative since ``install`` was called.

A client that moves its bytes outside Python - a native extension
carrying its own HTTP stack, as the object storage output does - never
touches a wrapped socket, so it reports what it transfers through
``record_sent``. Such a report covers the payload the client was handed,
not the protocol framing around it, so the counters understate that
traffic by the size of the headers and of whatever the client retried.

Bytes are counted per thread name, so a caller can read the traffic of
one part of the application - the threads a single generator runs, for
one - instead of the process total. Counters of a name outlive the
threads that carried it, which keeps the traffic of a thread pool that
is recreated over the lifetime of the application.
